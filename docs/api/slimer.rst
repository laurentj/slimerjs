``slimer`` is an object available automatically in scripts.



.. _slimer-clearHttpAuth:

clearHttpAuth()
-----------------------------------------

It clears all HTTP authentication that have been made. Then, when
a webpage needs an HTTP auth, username and password will be asked again.

See :doc:`doc about http authentication with SlimerJS <../manual/http-authentication>`.

Introduced: SlimerJS 0.9

.. _slimer-exit:

exit()
-----------------------------------------


It stops the script and SlimerJS exit.

It accepts an optional exit code. Default is 0. 

.. code-block:: javascript

    slimer.exit();


Note: your script may continue to be executed after the call of this method, because of
the asynchronous behavior of this function.

.. _slimer-isexiting:

isExiting()
-----------------------------------------

Indicate if ``exit()`` has been called. Since the exiting process is asynchronous,
scripts may continues to be executed after exit(). So the script may interrupts its
processing by checking this status

Introduced: SlimerJS 0.9.4

.. _slimer-hasfeature:

hasFeature(featureName)
-----------------------------------------

Returns ``true`` if the given feature is implemented **and** enabled.

It can indicate the state of these features:

- ``"coffeescript"``: indicates if CoffeeScript is available. It may be
  disabled in some case (during GhostDriver execution for example)

False is returned for all other feature unknown by this method.

containing three properties, ``major``, ``minor``, ``patch``:

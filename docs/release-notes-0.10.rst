Release Notes of SlimerJS 0.10
==============================

version 0.10.0
==============

Still in development

New API
-------

- ``webpage.render()`` can now generates PDF, BMP and ICO.
* ``webpage.onLongRunningScript`` and ``webpage.stopJavascript()`` to allow to be informed of
   webpage having long running scripts (compatible with Phantomjs 2)

Improvements
------------

- Exit code is now supported with ``slimer.exit()`` and ``phantom.exit()`` (except with slimerjs.bat)

Fixed bugs
----------

- Fixed configuration reading for script handlers (internal stuff)
- Callback given to ``webpage.open()`` is now really called after the page loading:
  it allows to call ``render()`` without a delay (``setTimeout``...)

Fixed PhantomJS conformance issues
----------------------------------

- a module should be able to call the ``return`` keyword

Other informations about this release

  SSL verification and Web security (CORS etc)
- no support of Ghost Driver (Selenium web driver)

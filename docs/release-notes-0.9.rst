Fixed bugs
----------

   * when a resource request is aborted, it doesn't abort anymore other requests (#130)

     it allows to call ``render()`` without a delay (``setTimeout``...).
     It avoids "pending is null" exception in some case...

     into their own process.

     content is application/x-www-form-urlencoded (#228)
   * Cookies: cookies set with ``phantom`` or ``webpage`` were not visible by default
     in the loaded document.cookie because of their httpOnly property setted with true

Other informations about this release
-------------------------------------

- New experimental startup script, ``slimerjs.py`` in python, which is a plateform independant script

----------------------------

Here are the PhantomJS 1.9 APIs that are missing in SlimerJS 0.9 but planed in future releases.

  are not supported yet. Some of them are the possibility to deactivate
  SSL verification and Web security (CORS etc)
- no support of Ghost Driver (Selenium web driver)
- page rendering into PDF

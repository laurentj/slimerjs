version 0.8
===========

This version is in development.

The compatibility with PhantomJS has been strongly increased and
some tools like CasperJS (version 1.1beta1 or higher) work almost
perfectly with SlimerJS 0.8.

Some packages of SlimerJS 0.8 embed directly XulRunner 22 (Gecko 22):
you don't have to install XulRunner or Firefox separately, nor
to set a SLIMERJSLAUNCHER environment variable. Unless you want to
use a different version of Gecko.

SlimerJS 0.8 should be also compatible with Firefox/XulRunner/Gecko 23
and 24.

- Implementation of ``webpage.uploadFile()`` and support of ``webpage.onFilePicker``
- Implementation of the cookie API on the ``phantom`` object

- support of the ``--local-storage-quota`` option on the command line

- Implementation of ``webpage.ownsPage``, ``webpage.getPage()``, ``webpage.pages``, ``webpage.pagesWindowName``
- Implementation of ``webpage.scrollPosition``
- Implementation of ``webpage.offlineStoragePath`` and  ``webpage.offlineStorageQuota``

  were not passed correctly to it.
- Fixed conformance to CommonJS filesystem/A module in ``fs.directory()``
- Fixed ``webpage.render()`` and ``webpage.renderBase64()``: default screenshot

  given javascript function is undefined.

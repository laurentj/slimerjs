XULRunner and documentation
===========================

SlimerJS is a XULRunner application. So it is built on top
Mozilla technologies like XUL, XPCom, and use Javascript as main language.

XULRunner is an executable, but also the "Mozilla Framework". Firefox is built
on top of XULRunner too. So when we talk about "XULRunner", we mean
"Mozilla Framework".

All documentation about XULRunner and XUL application development, is
on https://developer.mozilla.org/. You may want to look at
[the chapter of XULRunner](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XULRunner).
For example, ["Getting started with XULRunner"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Getting_started_with_XULRunner).

You can also take a look at:

- [Javascript language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [JSM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules), the internal
  javascript module system of Mozilla (*.jsm that you can find in src/modules/)
- [How to use and create XPCOM Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Creating_XPCOM_Components),
  the Cross Platform Component Object Module of Mozilla. Most of C++ components accessible
  through Javascript in a XULRunner application, are created using XPCOM. XPCOM Components
  can be also developped in Javascript. Some XPCOM components are developped in SlimerJS.
  You'll find them in src/components/
- [The Chrome URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/Tutorial/The_Chrome_URL),
  [Chrome registration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Chrome_Registration),
  and [definitions of the Chrome world](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Chrome).
  Note: we don't talk about the Google's browser. "Chrome" in Mozilla is a completely
  different thing. Google has just reused the name. Probably a wink to Mozilla ;-) (do
  you know that some early lead developers of Google Chrome came from Mozilla?)

The application launch
======================

When you launch the `slimer` executable, XULRunner (or Firefox) is called with the
path of the application.ini file.

First, xulrunner tries to call an XPCOM component that handles the commande line.
Fortunately, SlimerJS provides one in `src/components/commandline.js`. It is registered in the
"command-line-handler" XPCOM category in `src/chrome.manifest`, this is why XulRunner find
it.

The `handle()` method of this component is called. It uses the module `src/modules/slConfiguration.jsm`
to parse and store command line parameters. `slConfiguration` holds all configuration options
and this is where you declare command line parameters.

If `handle()` has no error, xulrunner open the window which is indicated into the
`toolkit.defaultChromeURI` preference. Preferences of SlimerJS are stored into
`defaults/preferences/prefs.js`.

To open an application window, XULRunner calls same function as `window.open()`, with a
"chrome://" URL. In a XUL application, every window has a chrome URL (type
`chrome://browser/content/browser.xul` in Firefox ;-) ).

In SlimerJS, the main window url points to the file
`src/chrome/slimerjs/content/slimerjs.xul`. `slimerjs.xul` is a very simple window. This will
be the parent window of all other windows that your script will open. Those child windows
are defined in `src/chrome/slimerjs/content/webpage.xul`, which has a simple `<browser>`
element (a kind of iframe in XUL). The web page is displayed by this element.

As you can see, `slimerjs.xul` has a `<script>` element, like in HTML. It loads the
`src/chrome/slimerjs/content/slimerjs.js` file.
This file is simple too. After the window loading, `startup()` is called,
which itself call the `slLauncher` component. This component loads and executes the
javascript file indicated on the command line, by using the
`src/modules/addon-sdk/toolkit/loader.js` component.

`loader.js` is able to load CommonJS modules in javascript sandboxes. slLauncher.jsm
defines options for the Loader (see `prepareLoader()`). Two of these options are high
level functions:

- `resolve()` to resolve path of modules given to `require()` in modules
- `load()` to prepare default objects for the sandbox of a module, and to call the
  low level function of `Loader` to load the module.

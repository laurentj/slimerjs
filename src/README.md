# SlimerJS

SlimerJS is a scriptable browser. It allows you to manipulate a web page
with a Javascript script: opening a webpage, clicking on links, modifying the content...
It is useful to do functional tests, page automaton, network monitoring, screen
capture etc.

It is a clone of [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) but it runs on top of
Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, instead of on top of webkit.

Go to [http://slimerjs.org] to know more. The documentation can be found
on [http://docs.slimerjs.org].

# Install

- Install [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com) (version 38 or more)
- [Download the latest package](https://download.slimerjs.org/releases/0.10.0/slimerjs-0.10.0.zip) or
  [the source code of SlimerJS](https://github.com/laurentj/slimerjs/archive/master.zip) if you didn't it yet
- On windows, a .bat is provided, but you can also launch slimer from a "true" console. In this case, you should install
  [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) or any other unix environment to launch slimerjs.
- SlimerJS needs to know where Firefox is stored. It tries to discover
  the path by itself but it can fail. You must then set the environment variable
  SLIMERJSLAUNCHER, which should contain the full path to the firefox binary:
   - On linux: ```export SLIMERJSLAUNCHER=/usr/bin/firefox```
   - on Windows: ```SET SLIMERJSLAUNCHER="c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe```
   - On windows with cygwin : ```export SLIMERJSLAUNCHER="/cygdrive/c/program files/mozilla firefox/firefox.exe"```
   - On MacOS: ```export SLIMERJSLAUNCHER=/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox```
- You can of course set this variable in your .bashrc, .profile or in the computer
   properties on Windows.

# Launching SlimerJS

Open a terminal and go to the directory of SlimerJS (src/ if you downloaded the
source code). Then launch:

```
    ./slimerjs myscript.js
```

In the Windows commands console:

```
    slimerjs.bat myscript.js
```


The given script myscripts.js is then executed in a window. If your script is
short, you probably won't see this window.

You can for example launch some tests if you execute SlimerJS from the source code:

```
    ./slimerjs ../test/launch-initial-tests.js
```

# Launching a headless SlimerJS

Unlike PhantomJS, SlimerJS is not "headless" (you see all windows it opens)
because of some limitations of Gecko.

But there is a tool called xvfb, available on Linux and MacOS. It allows to launch
any "graphical" programs without the need of X-Windows environment. Windows of
the application won't be shown and will be drawn only in memory.

Install it from your prefered repository (```sudo apt-get install xvfb```
with debian/ubuntu).

Then launch SlimerJS like this:

```
    xvfb-run ./slimerjs myscript.js
```

You won't see any windows. If you have any problems with xvfb, see its
documentation.
